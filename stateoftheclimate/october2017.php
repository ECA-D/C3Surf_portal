<h2>Autumn Storms</h2>
<br><br>
The first autumn storm of the season hit Europe on 5 and 6 October 2017. The storm caused considerable damage in a band from Holland, over northern Germany and into Poland. This windstorm, named Xavier by the German Weather Service (DWD), caused severe damage and left a number of people dead.
<br><br>
As the storm passed through the region, it produced wind gusts up to 35-40 m/s (130 km/h), downing trees, damaging buildings and causing severe traffic chaos.
<br><br>
Furthermore, many problems resulted from the high wind and storm surges occurred in Northern Germany and along the coasts of the Baltic Sea. In the image you can see the location of the vigorous developing low pressure area (October 5th 06Z) together with the track in the whole 48 hour period (denoted by the stars).
<br><br>
<a href="../images/oct2017/Plaatje_Storm_October_2017.png"><img alt="" src="../images/oct2017/Plaatje_Storm_October_2017.png" width="350px"></a>
<br><br>
<em>Figure 1: The location to the vigorous developing low pressure area on October 5th 06Z. The stars indicate the track of this depression in the 48 hour period.</em>
<br><br>
During the 5th of October wind gusts of 176 km/h occurred at station Brocken (Germany, 1134 m), 202 km/h at station Sniezka (Poland, 1603 m) and 122 km/h gusts were reported at Berlin airport (Germany); a great deal of damage resulted from fallen trees. At least seven people died and the public transport in northern Germany was severely disrupted (cancelled flights and cancelled long-distance trains to and from Berlin partly for several days).
<br><br>
Half-way through the month of October (on the 15, 16 and 17th), Storm Ophelia hit Ireland, Scotland and Norway. The storm, which reached wind speeds of 150 km/h, caused at least three deaths and significant material damage. About 360,000 Irish residents suffered from lost power supplies. The situation was exceptional: such a storm depression, formed out of a tropical hurricane of category 3, has never been so close to Europe. This year's hurricane season was very intense, with the simultaneous presence of three hurricanes: Irma, Jose and Katia.
<br><br>
Ophelia started as a tropical storm at about 1500 km southwest of the Azores and moved in a Northeast direction, and not to the West of the islands which is usual (Satellite film from Deutscher Wetterdienst: <a href="https://youtu.be/9fsPVgsJbc0" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/9fsPVgsJbc0</a>). On Saturday 14 October, Ophelia was still a hurricane of category 3. That was because of the exceptional sea surface temperatures, which were approximately two degrees higher than usual.
<br><br>
On the way to Ireland, Ophelia reduced to a tropical storm and gradually acquired the characteristics of a mid-latitude autumn storm, driven by the usual storm-jet stream dynamics at mid latitudes. The exceptional nature of Ophelia was that during this extra tropical transition the core of the storm still contained warm moist air, providing an additional driving force that is typical for tropical hurricanes.
<br><br>
Also a "sting jet" occurred: strong winds in the middle atmosphere (at an altitude of 3 to 4 km) that reached the ground for a short time. This would explain the very high wind speeds that were measured. These winds caused major damage, similar to <a href="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/learning/learn-about-the-weather/weather-phenomena/case-studies/great-storm" target="_blank">the great Storm of 16 October 1987</a>, exactly thirty years ago.

<br><br>
The exceptionally high surface temperatures and low precipitation amounts in Southwest Europe lead to devastating forest fires in Northern Portugal and Spain (Figure 2, left). Smoke from these fires as well as desert dust and sea salt, were detected by the <a href="https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu" target="_blank">Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service</a> (Figure 2, right), clearly indicating transport of these aerosols from to the North due too the strong southerly winds related to ex-hurricane Ophelia.

<br><br>
On October 17, LIDAR ceilometer measurements in De Bilt (Figure 3, left) indicated a significant amount of aerosol at an altitude between 0 and 3 km. Below 6 km no clouds were observed on this day. Figure 3 (right) shows the strong impact of the aerosol layer on direct surface radiation observed at the nearby BSRN station in Cabauw, the Netherlands.
<br><br>
Weather balloon measurements showed that the air temperature between 1 and 3 kilometers altitude was several degrees higher, while temperatures close to the ground were several degrees lower than predicted by regional models, that currently do not incorporate these aerosol dynamics.
<br><br>
<h2>The weather in October 2017</h2>
<h3>Temperature deviations and extremes</h3>
<br><br>
The distribution in October 2017 of the daily average temperatures over Europe based on surface observations, shows average or below average values in the East (Russia, Finland, Baltic states, Belarus) and much higher than normal values in Western and Central Europe (Figures 3 and 4). Spain, Portugal and Southern France stand out with exceptionally high values for the daily average temperature. This difference between East and West is even more prominent in the daily maximum temperatures (the rightmost maps in Figures 3 and 4). Interestingly, the East-West gradient is much less pronounced in the daily minimum temperature (leftmost maps in Figures 3 and 4). A likely cause for these observations are in the monthly averaged cloud cover and incoming solar radiation observed by Meteosat (Figures 13 and 14). They show a similar East - West gradient with high cloud cover / low incoming solar radiation in the East, and the opposite in Southwest Europe.

<br><br>
Figure 6 (left map) shows that much of Europe has seen (light) frost in October. Exceptions are Denmark, the Netherlands, Ireland, parts of Germany, Italy and much of the Iberian peninsula. Nevertheless, the highest temperatures in October in the Iberian peninsula still reached 30&#176;C which is exceptional. In northern Scandinavia, much of the area struggled to reach 5&#176;C as the highest October temperature, well below average, whereas on Norway's northernmost Atlantic shore, relatively mild temperatures of close to 10&#176;C were reached.

<strong>Evolution of the European land-surface temperature</strong>
<br><br>
Figure 8 (left panel) shows the European-averaged temperature from 1950 onward, where blue bars show temperatures which are below the 1981-2010 average and red bars above this mean value. The green bar is the provisional 2017 estimate, based on data until the end of October and climatological means for the remaining months. The grey bars in the panel indicate the estimated uncertainties which take into account the errors introduced by spatial interpolation over areas without observation stations, inhomogeneities in the temperature data that result from station relocations / changes in measurement instruments etc., and biases due to urbanisation, as documented in Van der Schrier et al., 2013 and Chrysanthou et al., 2014. The uncertainties tell us that although we are not 100% certain about the ranking of individual years, the overall positive trend since the 1980s is very pronounced.
The uncertainty in the provisional 2017 estimate relates to using the 10th and 90th percentile estimates for the missing months (November - December) in the annual estimates.
Figure 8 shows that the European averaged temperature for 2017 will be warmer than the 1981-2010 average, but is unlikely to be in the top-three of warmest years on record.
<br><br>
The right panel of Figure 8 shows the daily temperature, averaged over Europe, for the past 12 months. It shows that the winter and spring of 2017 have been very mild, whereas in the more recent months, the European-average temperature is below average - despite the warmth in southern Europe during the summer months.

<br><br>
An east-west split in precipitation was observed across Europe during October 2017 (Figures 9 and 10), with drier conditions in the west and wetter than normal conditions east of Germany.
<br><br>
Taking the averages of precipitation across five regions of Europe (Figure 11) shows that precipitation amounts across the regions were not particularly extreme. <!--The northwest and northeast regions of Europe were slightly wetter, while the central European and southeastern regions were slightly drier. The exception is southwest Europe, which saw about half (53%) of the usual precipitation for an average September (based on the 1981-2010 climatology). Based on this calculation, the 2017 September ranks as 10th driest since 1950.-->

<br><br>
In October in the Pyrenees no persistent snow cover existed. In the Alps the snow line was above 1500 m most of the time. Due to the warmer temperature the snow cover was less than normal. In most parts of central and eastern Europe snow was less than usual for October. Only in northern Europe (Sweden, Finland and northern European Russia) the snow cover extent was, at the end of the month, above normal. In Finland most of the country got its first snow at the end of the month. On the last day of October the country's eastern and northern parts had at most around 20 cm of snow. In Sweden the fresh fallen snow melted during the day, only at the end of October snow depth of more than 20 cm was registered. In European Russia at the end of the month the rain changed to snow. In Central Russia the fresh snow depth exceeded 10-15 cm. But soon this snow was melted. Snow even fell in the Crimea. Its depth in the mountain passes reached 30-40 cm.
In Austria in October there was less snow than normal. No snow was observed in mountains below 1000 m and at higher reaches between 1000 and 1500 m only one day with snow cover instead of 2 to 4 days. During the 22 and 23 October, the snow line on the northern side of the Swiss Alps fell to 1000 m and even reached 700 m in the Glarus region.

<h2><em>About the Copernicus State of the European Climate</em></h2>
<em>Monthly and yearly </em>State of the European Climate<em> bulletins are prepared for audience of mainly non-meteorologists/climatologists interested in impact of weather and climate. In these bulletins, the main features of the most recent calendar month is shown, with a focus on extremes and significant deviations from climatology. The information is provided within their historical context, and includes references to addional information. The bulletin is based on Copernicus products, but also contains information from other sources as appropriate.</em>
