<h2>Event in June 2019</h2>
<strong>Heatwave over southwestern and central Europe</strong>
<br><br>
In the last week of June exceptionally high temperatures occurred over central and southwestern parts of Europe. Locally maximum temperatures reached values of 40°C and higher (Fig. 1, left). Daily average temperatures between 25 to 29 June were largely around +7&#176;C and locally even +9&#176;C above normal (the average calculated from the climatological period 1981 to 2010) as shown in Fig. 1 on the right. As a result, numerous June records and all-time records for daily maximum temperature were broken at single stations. Partly also country-wide records were broken like in France, where the all-time temperature record at Gallargues-le-Montueux, Gard, near the city of N&#238;mes was broken on June 28 with a new record of 45.9&#176;C. This is more than 1.5&#176;C above the previous record of 44.1&#176;C in Conqueyrac, Gard. In other countries such as Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Austria, Italy, Slovenia and Croatia new station records for June were set, partly also all-time records. In Switzerland for example new June records were confirmed at more than 40 stations and new all-time records were confirmed at 6 mountain stations. Davos at almost 1600m elevation with 29.8&#176;C almost reached the 30&#176;C.
In Austria, the Netherlands, Czech Republic as well as in Germany, the whole month of June 2019 was the warmest ever recorded.

<em>Figure 1: Daily Maximum temperature (&#176;C) and daily average temperature anomalies (&#176;C) for Europe during 25 - 29 June (based on E-OBS).</em>
<br><br>
<br><br>
Like during many previous European heat spells, the high temperatures resulted from an extensive omega block developed over Europe. This omega block is named based on the shape created by the pressure patterns, where a high pressure system is located between two low pressure systems. As shown in Fig. 2, end of June, the high pressure system (H) was located over Europe with low pressure systems (L) over the North Atlantic and over southeastern Europe. The resulting shape looks similar to the Greek letter omega (see black line). Normally the pressure systems move, but during the omega block conditions the pressure systems are stuck in place for a longer period (ranging from days to even weeks). This omega block constellation over Europe led to hot air masses from Africa being transported over the Mediterranean to Europe (as indicated by the red arrow).

<h2>Specific climate indicators for June 2019</h2>
<br><br>
Temperatures were on average much higher than normal in a large part of Europe. The number of warm days (days with a maximutemperature > 90th percentile) was very high, especially in the (north)eastern part of Europe. The warm spell duration index (WSDI), defined as the number of consecutive days on which the daily maximum temperature exceeds the 90th percentile, with a minimum of six, is reaching ten at some locations in Eastern Europe. Also France, the Alpine Region and the northern part of Spain counted six or more consecutive warm days.

The first week of June heavy thunderstorms developed over the western part of Europe. Later in the month also heavy thunderstorms developed over southeastern Europe, locally resulting in one-day precipitation amounts of around 50 mm.

<h2>The weather in June 2019</h2>
<h3>Temperature deviations and extremes</h3>
<br><br>
Over most of Europe, the average temperature in June 2019 was higher than the 1981-2010 average for the month and it was particularly warm over parts of central and eastern Europe. Around the middle of the month temperature records were broken in eastern Europe. Then towards the end of the month (25-29 June), the western and central parts of the continent experienced a short but record-breaking heatwave, with daily average temperatures up to 10°C higher than normal (see event description). For the month as a whole, the only areas that were cooler than normal were western Iberia and parts of the British Isles. This distribution was due the main location of the upper trough over low pressure, from the British Isles towards western Iberia, and high pressure over the continent.

<strong>Evolution of the European land-surface temperature</strong>
<br><br>
Figure 10 (left panel) shows the European-averaged temperature from 1950 onward, where blue bars show temperatures which are below the 1981-2010 average and red bars above this mean value. The green bar is the provisional 2019 estimate, based on data until the end of June and climatological means for the remaining months. The grey bars in the panel indicate the estimated uncertainties which take into account the errors introduced by spatial interpolation over areas without observation stations, inhomogeneities in the temperature data that result from station relocations / changes in measurement instruments etc., and biases due to urbanisation, as documented in Van der Schrier et al. (2013) and Chrysanthou et al. (2014). The uncertainties tell us that although we are not 100% certain about the ranking of individual years, the overall positive trend since the 1980s is very pronounced.
<br><br>
The right panel of Figure 10 shows the daily temperature, averaged over Europe, for the past 12 months.

<br><br>
<h3>Precipitation</h3>
Due to the main influence of high pressure over the continent, we can see in general dry conditions over southwestern, central and eastern Europe. Parts of western Europe could see some high precipitation days due to the eruption of heavy thunderstorms in the first week of June.

<h3>Cloudiness and Radiation</h3>
<br><br>
Due to the strong high pressure area and corresponding significant subsidence, we can see a strong positive anomaly over radiation (negative anomaly in cloud cover) over much of the western- and central Europe. In an area from western Iberia into England a zone with negative anomalies in radiation can clearly been seen due to a lot of cloudy days corresponding with frontal systems which took a hold along the western edge of Europe.

<h2><em>About the Copernicus State of the European Climate</em></h2>
<em>Monthly and yearly </em>State of the European Climate<em> bulletins are prepared for audience of mainly non-meteorologists/climatologists interested in impact of weather and climate. In these bulletins, the main features of the most recent calendar month is shown, with a focus on extremes and significant deviations from climatology. The information is provided within their historical context, and includes references to addional information. The bulletin is based on Copernicus products, but also contains information from other sources as appropriate.</em>
