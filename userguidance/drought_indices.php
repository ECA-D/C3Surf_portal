<h3>CDD* and altCDD</h3>
&#9679; <i>Maximum no of consecutive dry days \((RR < 1 mm)\) (Days)</i> 
<br><br> 

Let \(RR_{ij}\) be the daily precipitation amount at day \(i\) of
period \(j\). Then counted is the largest no of consecutive days where: 
<br><br>

\(RR_{ij} < 1 mm\)
	    <br><br>
	    For CDD, the spells can span years, while for altCDD the spells cannot span years.

<h3>SPI3</h3>
&#9679; <i>3-Month Standardized Precipitation Index</i> 
<br><br> 

SPI is a probability index based on precipitation. It is designed to be a spatially invariant indicator of drought. SPI3 refers to precipitation in the previous 3-month period (\(+\) indicates wet; \(-\) indicates dry).

<h3>SPI6</h3>
&#9679; <i>6-Month Standardized Precipitation Index</i> 
<br><br> 

SPI is a probability index based on precipitation. It is designed to be a spatially invariant indicator of drought. SPI6 refers to precipitation in the previous 6-month period (\(+\) indicates wet; \(-\) indicates dry).
